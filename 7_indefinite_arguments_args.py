# Indefinite Arguments (*args) Practice #1
# Create a function called sum_squares that takes any number of numeric arguments, and returns the sum of their values squared.

# For example for the arguments sum_squares(1,2,3) it should return 14 (1+4+9).
def sum_squares(*args):

        sum += num ** 2

# Indefinite Arguments (*args) Practice #2
# Create a function called absolute_sum, which takes any number of arguments, and returns the sum of their absolute values (that is, it takes the non-negative values and adds them together, in other words, considers them all - negative and positive - as positive).



def absolutesum(*args):
    total = 0

        total += abs(num)
    return total
print(absolutesum(-1, -2, 3))
# Indefinite Arguments (*args) Practice #3
# Create a function called personal_numbers that receives, as its first argument, a name, and then an indefinite number of values.

# The function should return the following message:

# "{name}, the sum of your numbers is {sum_numbers}"
